              <p><strong>Its offical!</strong> The new champion Michael Bisping will face off against Dan Henderson at UFC 204 for the belt.</p>
              <p>Dan Henderson has stated several times, win or lose he will retire after this fight. He goes on to say he still has the strength, but ultimately feels its time to walk away</p>
              <p>and spend more time with his family. Bisping on the other hand states that "everyone knows (Dan Handerson) wont win." Bisping want to "irraticate" his brutal loss at UFC 100.</p>
              <p>A few fighters like Weidman, Rockhold and others are upset by this match, saying Henderson doesnt deserve the shot. Dan Henderson has almost every title but at UFC title in his history, will this change?</p>
              <p>Who will win? Will Henderson really retire? </p>

                <p><strong>Matt mitrione's Bellator debut has started with a knockout against, Carl Seumanutafa 3:22 into round one in St. Louis on June 24th, 2016. </strong> Although, it wasn't without a close call!</p>
                <p>Seumanutafa started the fight by being aggressive and hit Mitrione with a right hook that almost ended the fight. Mitrione was able to defend and recover after the collapsing blow to the head.</p>
                <p>Rampage headlining the Bellator 157, winning by a contraversal split decision against Satoshi Ishii. Ramapge seemed aggress at times, but tanking out towards the end. Ishii has something to prove.</p>
                <p>St. Louis. Judges’ scores were 29-28 (Sal D’Amato) and 30-27 (Robin Veale) for Jackson and 29-28 (Ross Swanberg) for Ishii.</p>
                <p>Although not impressed by Rampage's gasy irrate performance, I think both wins for Rampage and Mitrione should make for a good pay day for their envidiable long awaited match up. </p>
                <p>will Rampage and Mitrione fight soon? Is Rampage just getting too old?</p>

                  <p>Born in the Bahamas Kimbo moved to Florida as a kid, Slice gained internet fame in 2003 when videos of his unsanctioned Miami street fights began to explode on YouTube and other websites.</p>
                  <p>He would open his professional career record with three straight knockouts against the likes of Tank Abbott and James Thompson, but Slice’s career was derailed in October 2008 when
                  <p>he suffered a shocking knockout loss to late replacement Seth Petruzelli. Kimbo was scheduled to rematch James Thompson in Bellator on July 19th in Londo. After making Thompson's ear explode on TV.</p>

                  <p>Foul play? Was it Diet, Coaches pushing, or even Steriods? Should his coaches have taken more notice to his condtion?</p>

                  <p>Brock Lesnar was announced to fight at UFC 199 during a UFC 200 promo video. Lesnar has been out of the octagon for more than 4 years.</p>
                  <p>When asked why his sudden return, he stated his sickness and sugeries got in the way and he was not ready to walk away yet.</p>
                  <p>Lesnar is get to fight Mark Hunt during UFC 200, which is only right since Lesnar won the Heavyweight Title against Frank Mir at UFC 100</p>
                  <p>Lesnar was often critized for not being able to take a punch to the face, well Mark Hunt will be the perfect to test that theory.<p>
                  <p>Is this a one time fight contract? How much is WWE making? Why did Dana kick out Ariel over leaking this story of Lesnar's return?</p>
