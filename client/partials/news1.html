          <p><strong>Conor McGregor gives the public some clarity, kind of...</strong> The UFC champion posted the statement above on Thusrday, April 21st.</p>
          <p>McGregor will always be a fighter and that is why he got into this business to do. Fighters dont always like the spotlight, the fame, commericals,</p>
          <p>let alone the endless press campaigns. Nate Diaz responses again to Conor's social media statement, with this tweet:</p>

          <p>The Diaz's brothers are known for their dislike of media and promoting, yet Nate still showed up for UFC 200 demands..</p>
          <p>Dana White is in a tough situation, if you give into on fighter's demands you will have to give into alot more...</p>

              <p><strong>Conor McGregor made the internet go INSANE,</strong> with just one tweet that caused an giant chain reaction!</p>
              <p>Conor McGregor tweeted on April 19th, 2016 at 11:29am, announceing his retirment out of seemingly no where!</p>
              <p>Options: He is just playing and trying to cause more talk and promotions, there was a dispute was a contract/money issue, </p>
              <p> he is thinking about his long time health effects or wants to go out on top of the bank.</p>

            <p><strong>Bellator at is again!</strong> Rematch season is in full swing, both headlining events for Bellator London will be two historical rematches.</p>
            <p>Co main event is Daley vs Koscheck, last time the two were in the octogan Daley imfamously swang at Koscheck after the last round clearly bell rang,</p>
            <p>resulting in Daley's immediate termination from the UFC!</p>
            <p>Main event is Kimbo vs Thompson, Kimbo literally made Thompson's ear explode in 2008 the early stages of Kimbo's proffesional MMA career.</p>
            <p>Bellator continueing to aseemble some really entertaining cards. Will histroy rewrite itself or will it be a nightmare relived? </p>
            <p>After Kimbos last performance and holes in his ground game, the outcoming is really unpredictable.</p>
