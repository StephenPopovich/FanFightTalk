            <p><strong>UFC Hall of Famers Chuck Liddell and Forrest Griffin</strong> will serve as opposing coaches on the upcoming third season of “The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America,” UFC announced on April, 11th.</p>
            <p>“TUF: LATAM 3” will be the first season of the reality show to film in Argentina, with production slated to begin in Buenos Aires in late spring. The season premieres in August and will be streamed via UFC Fight Pass in the U.S.</p>
            <p> Canal 5 will broadcast the show in Mexico, with 14 additional networks airing the series throughout Latin America.</p>
            <p>UFC will return to Mexico City for a Nov. 5 event which will feature the final round of the season-long “TUF: LATAM 3” tournament. </p>
            <p>Weight classes and competitors for the series have not been announced; male and female fighters from all weight classes were invited to compete at the January tryouts.</p>
            <p>Former UFC light heavyweight champions Liddell and Griffin are no strangers to “The Ultimate Fighter”, Both being coaches before (TUF Season 1 and TUF Season 7)</p>
            <p>The future of the show is unclear, since it seems that another set of UFC coaches will not fight at the end of the season. A major original lure of the show.</p>
            <p>Whether the fight happens or not, fighters come out of retirement and everyone would like to see these two legends at it one last time.</p>

            <p><strong>Former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir,</strong> said on his Phone Booth Fighting podcast on April 9th that he would more than likely retire if he is suspended two years by USADA for failing a drug test.</p>
            <p>Mir says he indeed did test positive for anabolic steroid metabolites and is now facing a two-year suspension from USADA.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"That was probably my last time fighting," Mir said. ... "I don't see any other way around it. Age is catching up to me now. I'm not gonna get any younger in the next two years." </span></p>
            <p>Mir, 36 years old, said USADA found a small trace of an oral turinabol metabolites in his system in relation to his fight with Mark Hunt at UFC Fight Night 85 in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
            <p>During the 65-minute podcast Mir offers no real explanation as to the source of the metabolites, except for <span class="quote"> “maybe it was kangaroo or crocodile meat,” </span> spending most of the podcast why it simply didn’t make sense for him to take PEDs.</p>
            <p>The fight took place March 19th, 2016 and Mir lost via first-round KO, he had never failed a drug test in his 15-year UFC career until now. Peds continues to a big problem to the MMA world,</p>
            <p>even with stricter rules and more random testing. Who's next? </p>
