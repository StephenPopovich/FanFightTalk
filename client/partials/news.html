              <p><strong>You'd think fighters would have caught on by now that you cant get away with anything while USADA around cleaning up the sport.</strong> Jon Jones popped for estrigion blockers merely a few days before UFC 200.</p>
              <p>Jon Jones will get the standard two year band and recieve no specail treatement. He gave an apology shortly after word broke, see video above left. Jones was set to fight DC, but was replaced by Anderson Silva.</p>
              <p>DC did not get to close, but won by decision in his UFC bout. In his first MMA bout in nearly five years, Lesnar defeated Mark Hunt via unanimous decision in the co-main event of UFC 200 on July 9th. Prior to the fight,</p>
              <p>Lesnar laughed off his opponent’s accusations that he was “juiced to the gills.” He went on to state its "unprofessional" to juice at a top level like this...</p>
              <p>Also going on to say on air that he's "white and jacked get over it!" Mark Hunt responses with this tweet:</p>

                <p>Was Nick Diaz right, is everyone on roids? What is Brocks future? Will Mark Hunt get any of the purse? Will Jones be that same after two years out?</p>

                <p><strong>Nunez, Brock, DC, Aldo, Cain all came out on top at UFC 200!</strong> UFC pulled off yet another historical event.</p>
                <p>Nunez domiantes Tate with a bloody rear naked choke and once against the Bantam wieght woman's belt switchs hands, but Tate takes the lose gracefully.</p>
                <p>DC and Aldo stay desputed champions, but unlike DC, Aldo will rematch Conor after his long awaited fight with Diaz with Nate Diaz.</p>
                <p>Brock wins after five years out of the octagon, which goes to show you the WWE keeps their stars in shape and his isolation in Canada proves to be a great trainging tactic</p>
                <p>Whats next for Brock? Will DC be able to beat Jones when he returnes in two years? Does Aldo have a chance this time around?</p>
