                <p>Conor's Tweet:</p>
                <img src="/static/images/tweet5.png" alt="" />
                <p>Conor posted this tweet earlier this week out of the blew after Dana white stated serval times at the UFC 200 conference he wont not be fighting at UFC200.</p>
                <p>Dana White later replies confused like rest of us, Dana had this to say:</p>
                <p><span class="quote">“It's not true. We haven't talked to Conor or his manger since the press conference."</span> Conor push to press Dana into giving has failed.</p>
                <p>UFC isnt budging on this one, promote or you dont fight. Simple as that, contracts should be clear and nagotiations should take place prior to any promoting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col 8">
                <p>Diaz's Tweet:</p>
                <img src="/static/images/tweet6.png" alt="" />
            </div>
          <div class="col s12">

              <p><strong>Nate Diaz</strong> kept his word. If the money isn't right he is not going to fight. Especially, after all the fuss over a rematch with Conor.</p>
                  <p>Somewhere Dana is shaking his head and Conor is swearing his head off. Another fight we will have to wait just a little longer.<p>
                  <p>Hopefully next time, both will be fully prepared before stepping back into the octagon together.</p>

              <p><strong>Jon Jones beats OSP in unamious decision,</strong> as he leaves he makes sure Daniel Cormier (DC) knows he is next and flips him off on PPV!</p>
                <p>DC brushes off, but looks a bit worried. He seemed in good health while communtating his future opponents fight during UFC197</p>
                  <p>Jones has gone on reach to say he is skeptical of DC's leg injury. One thing is certain there two hate each other</p>
                  <p>A rematch we will continue to wait for, but will definately be worth the wait. Who will win? Will DC stay healthy? Will Jones stay out of trouble til then?<p>

            <p><strong>Conor McGregor, UFC200 and alot of questions</strong> sums up UFC200's first press conference.</p>
            <p>Diaz has only one thing to say to Conor:</p>
            <p><span class="quote">“Conor got his ass beat.”</span> Diaz reminds everyone why he's "Stockton's Bad Boy"</p>
            <p>Diaz goes on to say he is here to fight McGregor and McGreogr only, if not he will go on vacation, one he can easily offered after his win.</p>
            <p>There were boos, pleads and countless people trying to conivce Dana to let up and give the fans what they want, A FIGHT!</p>
            <p>Dana White continued to stay by his word of pulling Conor for the epic event, leaving an empty seat where Diaz next opponent should be.</p>
            <p>Where is Diaz going on vacation? Is this all just for press? Would you want to be Dana White right now?</p>
