              <p><strong>Kevin Ferguson (Kimbo Slice) dies at the age of 42</strong> due to heart failure on Monday, June 6th, 2016.</p>
              <p>Kimbo lived in Coral Springs, Flordia. According to a Facebook post from an associate of Slice’s named Tyler Cook, the fighter’s death was related to heart problems.</p>
              <p>Born in the Bahamas Kimbo moved to Florida as a kid, Slice gained internet fame in 2003 when videos of his unsanctioned Miami street fights began to explode on YouTube and other websites.</p>
              <p>He would open his professional career record with three straight knockouts against the likes of Tank Abbott and James Thompson, but Slice’s career was derailed in October 2008 when
              <p>he suffered a shocking knockout loss to late replacement Seth Petruzelli. Kimbo was scheduled to rematch James Thompson in Bellator on July 19th in Londo. After making Thompson's ear explode on TV.</p>
              <p>Foul play? Was it Diet, Coaches pushing, or even Steriods? Should his coaches have taken more notice to his condtion?</p>

              <p>Brock Lesnar was announced to fight at UFC 199 during a UFC 200 promo video. Lesnar has been out of the octagon for about 4 years,</p>
              <p>When asked why his sudden return, he stated his sickness and sugeries got in the way and he was not ready to walk away yet.</p>
              <p>Lesnar is get to fight Mark Hunt during UFC 200, which is only right since Lesnar won the Heavyweight Title against Frank Mir at UFC 100</p>
              <p>Lesnar was often critized for not being able to take a punch to the face, well Mark Hunt will be the perfect to test that theory.<p>
              <p>Is this a one time fight contract? How much is WWE making? Why did Dana kick out Ariel over leaking this?</p>
