              <p><strong>Conor Mcgregor</strong> tweeted late April 24th, 2016 that he will in fact be on UFC200 and went on to thank the owners of the UFC for giving the fans what they want.</p>

                  <p>Dana White made a statemnt in response:<p>
                  <p><span class="quote">"It's not true. We havent talk to Conor or his manager since the press conference."</span></p>
                  <p>Is this another move for Conor push for power? Or a radical move to put a part of a historica event for the sport.<p>
                  <p>Although, Conor's agenda is unclear, one thing is for sure. He seriously thinks he will be apart of UFC200.</p>
                  <p>Dana White has yet to cave in and on numerous occasions has said Conor will not be part of UFC200, because of not wanting to certain promotions</p>
=======
              <p><strong>Conor Mcgregor</strong> was the middleweight co-main event of UFC on Fox 19 against Dan Henderson, but  has been removed from the card after Machida admitted to using a banned substance.</p>

                  <p>UFC released a statement on April 10th:<p>
                  <p><span class="quote">“Machida stated that he was unaware that the substance was prohibited both in and out of competition and, in accordance with the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, his disclosure of usage will be taken into consideration by USADA during any potential results management and adjudication process”</span></p>
                  <p>Lyoto released statement on April 13th:<p>
                  <p><span class="quote">I'm here to tell you that I was caught by surprise by this news. It has been very difficult for me. I've trained a lot for this fight, I've dedicated a lot with all my teammates,” Machida wrote. “I want to tell you that I really didn't know about this substance,</span></p>
                  <p><span class="quote">so I listed it on my declaration form amongst everything else I was taking, and this substance was recently banned in 2016, so I take the blame for not knowing that, and I'd like to say I'm really sorry and apologize to my fans, teammates, and my family... I always try to play by the book, but unfortunately this happened.”</span></p>
                  <p>Machida has lost three of his last four UFC fights, including a third-round technical knockout defeat to Yoel Romero at UFC Fight Night in Hollywood, Fla., this past June. He previously defeated Dan Henderson via split decision at UFC 157 in February 2013.</p>

              <p><strong>Jon Jones beats OSP in unamious decision,</strong> as he leaves he makes sure Daniel Cormier (DC) knows he is next and flips him off on PPV!</p>
                <p>DC brushes off, but looks a bit worried. He seemed in good health while communtating his future opponents fight during UFC197</p>
                  <p>Jones has gone on reach to say he is skeptical of DC's leg injury. One thing is certain there two hate each other</p>
                  <p>A rematch we will continue to wait for, but will definately be worth the wait. Who will win? Will DC stay healthy? Will Jones stay out of trouble til then?<p>
