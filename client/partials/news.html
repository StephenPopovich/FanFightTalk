              <p><strong>McGregor wins!</strong> McGregor gets his revenge on Nate Diaz by decision during UFC 202. Once again, a diaz brother loses in decision.</p>
              <p>Controversial or not there will be a third fight against the two warriors, but first McGregor must defend his 145lb belt against Jose Aldo or faces losing his belt.</p>
              <p>As for Nate Diaz, he thought he won and his next fight after this is unclear on who his opponent will be. One thing is certain, Nate Diaz is fan favorite.</p>
              <p>"Rumble" Johnson goes on to remind us why his nickname is "Rumble", but dilverying a brutal uppercut in the first round KOing Glover Teixeira. Teixeria was hit so hard he didn't realize</p>
              <p>the fight was over. If I were DC or Jones I would be a bit worried about those heavy hands of Johnson.</p>
              <p>Will McGregor listen to Dana White and fight Jose Aldo? Who will Nate Diaz fight next? Will Johnson fight DC next? </p>

                <p><strong>It's finally offical!</strong> The new champion Michael Bisping will face off against Dan Henderson at UFC 204 for the belt.</p>
                <p>Dan Henderson has stated several times, win or lose he will retire after this fight. He goes on to say he still has the strength, but ultimately feels its time to walk away</p>
                <p>and spend more time with his family. Bisping on the other hand states that "everyone knows (Dan Handerson) wont win." Bisping want to "irraticate" his brutal loss at UFC 100.</p>
                <p>A few fighters like Weidman, Rockhold and others are upset by this match, saying Henderson doesnt deserve the shot. Dan Henderson has almost every title but at UFC title in his history, will this change?</p>
                <p>Who will win? Will Henderson really retire? </p>

                <p><strong>Mcgregor does it again!</strong>Mcgregor manages to remain the talk of the MMA world by calling out WWE, twice!</p>
                <p>First in a phone press conference, by calling all the wrestlers in the WWE "pussies", except for a choice few. Some of the wrestlers Mcgregor respects were </p>
                <p>Triple H, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin. The second was in a recent interview (see video above), where Mcgregor insult Make A Wish record holder John Cena.</p>
                <p>Mcgregor calls him old, fat, and a failed olympian. The backlash was more or exactly what Mcgregor was expecting. I dont think he knows the amount of good Cena has done outside the ring.</p>
                <p>Cena has done countless charities, has done more "Make A Wish" dreams come true than any celeb, fundraisers and shows for troops in high danger zones. Many believe this is a plot to inovle and</p>
                <p>amp up Mcgregor and Wrestlemania this year. Will Mcgregor be in Wrestlemania? Is this a stunt? Will more WWE stars try MMA?</p>

              <p><strong>You'd think fighters would have caught on by now that you cant get away with anything while USADA around cleaning up the sport.</strong> Jon Jones popped for estrigion blockers merely a few days before UFC 200.</p>
              <p>Jon Jones will get the standard two year band and recieve no specail treatement. He gave an apology shortly after word broke, see video above left. Jones was set to fight DC, but was replaced by Anderson Silva.</p>
              <p>DC did not get to close, but won by decision in his UFC bout. In his first MMA bout in nearly five years, Lesnar defeated Mark Hunt via unanimous decision in the co-main event of UFC 200 on July 9th. Prior to the fight,</p>
              <p>Lesnar laughed off his opponent’s accusations that he was “juiced to the gills.” He went on to state its "unprofessional" to juice at a top level like this...</p>
              <p>Also going on to say on air that he's "white and jacked get over it!" Mark Hunt responses with this tweet:</p>

                <p>Was Nick Diaz right, is everyone on roids? What is Brocks future? Will Mark Hunt get any of the purse? Will Jones be that same after two years out?</p>

                <p><strong>Nunez, Brock, DC, Aldo, Cain all came out on top at UFC 200!</strong> UFC pulled off yet another historical event.</p>
                <p>Nunez domiantes Tate with a bloody rear naked choke and once against the Bantam wieght woman's belt switchs hands, but Tate takes the lose gracefully.</p>
                <p>DC and Aldo stay desputed champions, but unlike DC, Aldo will rematch Conor after his long awaited fight with Diaz with Nate Diaz.</p>
                <p>Brock wins after five years out of the octagon, which goes to show you the WWE keeps their stars in shape and his isolation in Canada proves to be a great trainging tactic</p>
                <p>Whats next for Brock? Will DC be able to beat Jones when he returnes in two years? Does Aldo have a chance this time around?</p>
