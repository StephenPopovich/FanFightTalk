              <p><strong>Conor Mcgregor</strong> tweeted late April 24th, 2016 that he will in fact be on UFC200 and went on to thank the owners of the UFC for giving the fans what they want.</p>

                  <p>Dana White made a statemnt in response:<p>
                  <p><span class="quote">"It's not true. We havent talk to Conor or his manager since the press conference."</span></p>
                  <p>Is this another move for Conor push for power? Or a radical move to put a part of a historica event for the sport.<p>
                  <p>Although, Conor's agenda is unclear, one thing is for sure. He seriously thinks he will be apart of UFC200.</p>
                  <p>Dana White has yet to cave in and on numerous occasions has said Conor will not be part of UFC200, because of not wanting to certain promotions</p>

              <p><strong>Jon Jones beats OSP in unamious decision,</strong> as he leaves he makes sure Daniel Cormier (DC) knows he is next and flips him off on PPV!</p>
                <p>DC brushes off, but looks a bit worried. He seemed in good health while communtating his future opponents fight during UFC197</p>
                  <p>Jones has gone on reach to say he is skeptical of DC's leg injury. One thing is certain there two hate each other</p>
                  <p>A rematch we will continue to wait for, but will definately be worth the wait. Who will win? Will DC stay healthy? Will Jones stay out of trouble til then?<p>
