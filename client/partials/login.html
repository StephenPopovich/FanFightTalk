                <p ><strong>Portuguese welterweight Joao “Rafeiro” Carvalho has died after suffering a knockout loss at an MMA event in Dublin over the weekend.</strong></p>
                  <p>Carvalho was stopped by Charlie Ward (Cono Mcgregor's teammate) in the third round of the fight at an April 9th event promoted by Irish organization Total Extreme Fighting (TEF).</p>
                    <p>TEF on Tuesday issued a statement via Facebook describing the aftermath of Carvalho’s bout.TEF stated that Carvalho passed away Monday night <span class="quote"> “after [two] days of the best medical care and treatment in Beaumont Hospital."</spam></p>
                    <p>Carvalho’s coach, Vitor Nobrega said in a written statement:<p>
                    <p><span class="quote">“He was assessed immediately by the on-site medical team, and then quickly transported to Beaumont Hospital, where he underwent brain surgery, after which the athlete remained in critical condition for the next 48 hours.”</span></p>
                    <p>Our thoughts and prayers go out to Joao Carvalho's family, friends and teammates...MMA is a dangerous sport and each every fighter understand this before stepping in the cage. This will not stop the growth of this sport, but may slow it.</p>

            <div class="col s6">
              <p><strong>Legend BJ Penn,</strong> Promotion officials announced on April 12th, that Penn will throw down with Dennis Siver in on the June 4th at the The Forum in Los Angeles on PPV.</p>
              <p>UFC 199 is headlined by a middleweight title rematch pitting Luke Rockhold against Chris Weidman. Penn’s return is reported to have been delayed due to an accusation of sexual assault.</p>
              <p><span class="quote">“We have taken a look at the available facts, which aren't too substantial, and there are two stories of what happened.”</span> - Lawrence Epstein (UFC's chief operating officer) told Yahoo Sports.</p>
              <p><span class="quote">“To date, there has no action at all taken by any law enforcement agency. We decided to allow B.J. to fight. However, we are going to continue to monitor to the situation. If new information,</p>
              <p><span class="quote"> more information, becomes available to us, obviously, we reserve the right to reevaluate.”</p>
              <p>Penn recently announced that he was coming out of retirement and would train with Greg Jackson in Albuquerque, N.M. Penn fought professionally since “The Ultimate Fighter 19” finale, where he suffered a third-round TKO</p>
              <p>loss to Frankie Edgar. The 37-year-old Hawaiian has won just one of his last seven Octagon appearances. Dennis Siver will be a fair matcha and hopefully Penn can end his legendary career with a win.</p>

              <p><strong>UFC Hall of Famers Chuck Liddell and Forrest Griffin</strong> will serve as opposing coaches on the upcoming third season of “The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America,” UFC announced on April, 11th.</p>
              <p>“TUF: LATAM 3” will be the first season of the reality show to film in Argentina, with production slated to begin in Buenos Aires in late spring. The season premieres in August and will be streamed via UFC Fight Pass in the U.S.</p>
              <p> Canal 5 will broadcast the show in Mexico, with 14 additional networks airing the series throughout Latin America.</p>
              <p>UFC will return to Mexico City for a Nov. 5 event which will feature the final round of the season-long “TUF: LATAM 3” tournament. </p>
              <p>Weight classes and competitors for the series have not been announced; male and female fighters from all weight classes were invited to compete at the January tryouts.</p>
              <p>Former UFC light heavyweight champions Liddell and Griffin are no strangers to “The Ultimate Fighter”, Both being coaches before (TUF Season 1 and TUF Season 7)</p>
              <p>The future of the show is unclear, since it seems that another set of UFC coaches will not fight at the end of the season. A major original lure of the show.</p>
              <p>Whether the fight happens or not, fighters come out of retirement and everyone would like to see these two legends at it one last time.</p>
