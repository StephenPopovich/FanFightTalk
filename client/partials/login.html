              <p><strong>Legend BJ Penn,</strong> Promotion officials announced on April 12th, that Penn will throw down with Dennis Siver in on the June 4th at the The Forum in Los Angeles on PPV.</p>
              <p>UFC 199 is headlined by a middleweight title rematch pitting Luke Rockhold against Chris Weidman. Penn’s return is reported to have been delayed due to an accusation of sexual assault.</p>
              <p><span class="quote">“We have taken a look at the available facts, which aren't too substantial, and there are two stories of what happened,”</span>Lawrence Epstein, the UFC's chief operating officer told Yahoo Sports.</p>
              <p><span class="quote">“To date, there has no action at all taken by any law enforcement agency. We decided to allow B.J. to fight. However, we are going to continue to monitor to the situation. If new information,</p>
              <p><span class="quote"> more information, becomes available to us, obviously, we reserve the right to reevaluate.”</p>
              <p>Penn recently announced that he was coming out of retirement and would train with Greg Jackson in Albuquerque, N.M. Penn fought professionally since “The Ultimate Fighter 19” finale, where he suffered a third-round TKO</p>
              <p>loss to Frankie Edgar. The 37-year-old Hawaiian has won just one of his last seven Octagon appearances. Dennis Siver will be a fair matcha and hopefully Penn can end his legendary career with a win.</p>

              <p><strong>UFC Hall of Famers Chuck Liddell and Forrest Griffin</strong> will serve as opposing coaches on the upcoming third season of “The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America,” UFC announced on April, 11th.</p>
              <p>“TUF: LATAM 3” will be the first season of the reality show to film in Argentina, with production slated to begin in Buenos Aires in late spring. The season premieres in August and will be streamed via UFC Fight Pass in the U.S.</p>
              <p> Canal 5 will broadcast the show in Mexico, with 14 additional networks airing the series throughout Latin America.</p>
              <p>UFC will return to Mexico City for a Nov. 5 event which will feature the final round of the season-long “TUF: LATAM 3” tournament. </p>
              <p>Weight classes and competitors for the series have not been announced; male and female fighters from all weight classes were invited to compete at the January tryouts.</p>
              <p>Former UFC light heavyweight champions Liddell and Griffin are no strangers to “The Ultimate Fighter”, Both being coaches before (TUF Season 1 and TUF Season 7)</p>
              <p>The future of the show is unclear, since it seems that another set of UFC coaches will not fight at the end of the season. A major original lure of the show.</p>
              <p>Whether the fight happens or not, fighters come out of retirement and everyone would like to see these two legends at it one last time.</p>

              <p><strong>Former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir,</strong> said on his Phone Booth Fighting podcast on April 9th that he would more than likely retire if he is suspended two years by USADA for failing a drug test.</p>
              <p>Mir says he indeed did test positive for anabolic steroid metabolites and is now facing a two-year suspension from USADA.</p>
              <p><span class="quote">"That was probably my last time fighting," Mir said. ... "I don't see any other way around it. Age is catching up to me now. I'm not gonna get any younger in the next two years." </span></p>
              <p>Mir, 36 years old, said USADA found a small trace of an oral turinabol metabolites in his system in relation to his fight with Mark Hunt at UFC Fight Night 85 in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
              <p>During the 65-minute podcast Mir offers no real explanation as to the source of the metabolites, except for <span class="quote"> “maybe it was kangaroo or crocodile meat,” </span> spending most of the podcast why it simply didn’t make sense for him to take PEDs.</p>
              <p>The fight took place March 19th, 2016 and Mir lost via first-round KO, he had never failed a drug test in his 15-year UFC career until now. Peds continues to a big problem to the MMA world,</p>
              <p>even with stricter rules and more random testing. Who's next? </p>
