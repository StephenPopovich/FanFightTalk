                  <p>Conor posted this tweet earlier this week randomly, after Dana white stated serval times at the UFC 200 conference he wont not be fighting at UFC200.</p>
                  <p>Dana White later replies confused like rest of us, Dana had this to say:</p>
                  <p><span class="quote">“It's not true. We haven't talked to Conor or his manger since the press conference."</span> Conor push to pressure Lorenzo Fertitta and Dana White into giving in has failed.</p>
                  <p>UFC isn't budging on this one, promote or you dont fight. Simple as that, contracts should be clearer and nagotiations should take place prior to any promoting.</p>
                  <p>The fans are getting the bad end of the stick with all these delayed fights and rematches.</p>

            <div class="col s12">

                <p><strong>Nate Diaz</strong> kept his word. If the money isn't right he is not going to fight. Especially, after all the fuss over a rematch with Conor.</p>
                    <p>Somewhere Dana is shaking his head and Conor is swearing his head off in a gym. Another fight we will have to wait just a little longer for...<p>
                    <p>Hopefully next time, both will be fully prepared before stepping back into the octagon together full camp, focus and all.</p>

                <p><strong>Jon Jones beats OSP in a unamious decision,</strong> as he leaves he makes sure Daniel Cormier (DC) knows he is next and flips him off live on PPV!</p>
                  <p>DC brushes it off as he still sits in the commentatory box, but looks a bit worried. He seemed in good health while commentating his future opponents fight during UFC197.</p>
                    <p>Jones has gone on reach to say he is skeptical of DC's leg injury. The future is unclear of both fighters, but the hate is real between these two.</p>
                    <p>A rematch we will continue to wait for, but will definately be worth the wait. Who will win? Will DC stay healthy? Will Jones stay out of trouble til then?<p>

              <p>Diaz reminds everyone why he's "Stockton's Bad Boy", keeping the trash talk short and sweet.</p>
              <p>Diaz goes on to say he is here to fight McGregor and McGreogr only, if not he will go on vacation, one he can easily offered after his win.</p>
              <p>There were boos, pleads and countless people trying to conivce Dana to let up and give the fans what they want, A FIGHT!</p>
              <p>Dana White continued to stay by his word of pulling Conor for the epic event, leaving an empty seat where Diaz next opponent should be.</p>
              <p>Where is Diaz going on vacation? Is this all just for press and free promoting? Would you want to be Dana White right now?</p>
