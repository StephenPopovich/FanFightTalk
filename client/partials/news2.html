            <p><strong>Former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir,</strong> said on his Phone Booth Fighting podcast on April 9th that he would more than likely retire if he is suspended two years by USADA for failing a drug test.</p>
            <p>Mir says he indeed did test positive for anabolic steroid metabolites and is now facing a two-year suspension from USADA.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"That was probably my last time fighting," Mir said. ... "I don't see any other way around it. Age is catching up to me now. I'm not gonna get any younger in the next two years." </span></p>
            <p>Mir, 36 years old, said USADA found a small trace of an oral turinabol metabolites in his system in relation to his fight with Mark Hunt at UFC Fight Night 85 in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
            <p>During the 65-minute podcast Mir offers no real explanation as to the source of the metabolites, except for <span class="quote"> “maybe it was kangaroo or crocodile meat,” </span> spending most of the podcast why it simply didn’t make sense for him to take PEDs.</p>
            <p>The fight took place March 19th, 2016 and Mir lost via first-round KO, he had never failed a drug test in his 15-year UFC career until now. Peds continues to a big problem to the MMA world,</p>
            <p>even with stricter rules and more random testing. Who's next? </p>
