            <p><strong>Bellator at is again!</strong> Rematch season is in full swing, both headlining events for Bellator London will be two historical rematches.</p>
            <p>Co main event is Daley vs Koscheck, last time they were in the octogan Daley famoulsy his Koscheck after the last round bell rang,</p>
            <p>resulting in Daley's termination from the UFC!</p>
            <p> Main event is Kimbo vs Thompson, Kimbo literally made Thompson's ear explode in 2008 the early stages of Kimbo's proffesional MMA career.</p>
            <p>Bellator continueing to putting together entertaining cards. Will histroy rewrite itself or will it be a nightmare relived? </p>
            <p>After Kimbos last performance and holes in his ground game, the outcoming is unpredictable.</p>
